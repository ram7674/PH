              â€œSchedule your first prenatal appointment for pregnancy care, once
              your pregnancy is confirmed. It comprises of the following
              aspects:

            <ul className="care__desc">
              <li>Medical history</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              Our signature pregnancy care is an inverted pyramid of antenatal
              care which is a novel concept of antenatal care focusing on the
              very early weeks of pregnancy to identify high risks and this
              enables much more individualized patient and disease-specific
              approach of antenatal care.
            </p>
            <p>
              For normal pregnancies without complications prenatal examinations
              are scheduled as follows:
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

            <ul className="care__desc">
              <li>Every month from the 1st week to the 28th week.</li>
              <li>Every 2 weeks from the 29th week through the 36th</li>
              <li>Weekly from the 37th week until delivery.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Apart from the routine antenatal checkups which assess BP, weight,
              the progress of the pregnancy care and overall well-being, there
              are certain trimester-specific investigations or treatments which
              will be offered to pregnant women depending on the individualized
              need.

                Basic care for all newborns should include keeping the baby
                warm, supporting early and exclusive breastfeeding, providing
                hygienic umbilical cord and skin care, increasing hand washing
                and, identifying conditions that require counseling and care
                when to take a newborn to a health facility.

              <li>
                They should be assessed for gestational age, birth weight,

            <h3>New born Screening</h3>
            <p>
              We also offer routine newborn screening. Newborn screening
              identifies certain genetic, endocrine and metabolic conditions
              that can affect a child's long-term health or survival. Early
              diagnosis and intervention can prevent death or disability.
            </p>

            <h3>Newborn Infant Hearing Screening</h3>
            <p>
              The auditory sense is important for the mental development of a
              child. About 5-6 out of 1000 children have hearing problems.
              Children identified with hearing loss before 6 months of age
              should have developing skills. Children not identified until later
              may ultimately suffer from irreversible and permanent impairments
              in speech, language, and cognitive abilities when compared to
              their peers.
            </p>

            <h3>Vaccination</h3>
            <ul className="care__desc">
              <li>
                Vaccines are an important part of keeping your child safe and
                healthy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Newborn babies need to have a list of doses of vaccines as per
                the vaccination chart recommended by the pediatricians in India.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each vaccine helps prevent a disease from surfacing in your
                little one and hence, all of them are mandatory.
